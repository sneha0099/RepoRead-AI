## How It Works

1. **Authenticate GitHub**
   - Users sign in via OAuth and grant secure access.
   - GitRead.AI securely exchanges a temporary code for an encrypted access token and stores it only for the session.

2. **Code Analysis**
   - The app uses **Langchain to chunk, parse, and analyze** your entire repository.
   - It understands your project‚Äôs structure, dependencies, and logic‚Äîall while preserving full context.

3. **README Generation**
   - The processed context is sent to the LLM, which generates a polished, developer-ready README.
   - The output includes detailed sections like Features, Installation, Project Architecture, API Routes, Tech Stack, and more.
